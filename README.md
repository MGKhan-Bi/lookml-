Explanation
Model File: The model file defines your connection and sets up an explore named hospital_claims. It joins in related views for patients and insurance policies.
View Files: Each view maps to a table in your database and defines dimensions (fields for filtering and grouping) and measures (aggregations like sum and average). For instance, the hospital_claims view includes measures to calculate total charges and average length of stay.
Customization: Youâ€™ll need to update table names (e.g., your_dataset.hospital_claims) and connection names to match your environment.
